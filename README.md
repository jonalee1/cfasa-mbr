Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a cornerstone of measurement in the social and behavioral sciences, yet its classical formulation presumes measurement invariance and linear indicator-construct relationships that are rarely satisfied. These assumptions mask systematic differences in how constructs are expressed across individuals and limit the ability of measurement models to represent nonlinear structure. We introduce Confirmatory Factor Analysis with Self-Attention (CFASA), an individual-centric measurement framework that reconceptualizes factor loadings as dynamic, person-specific attention weights. CFASA separates overall construct intensity, captured by factor scores, from the allocation of that intensity across indicators, captured by attention weights constrained to a probability simplex. This separation permits measurement structure to vary across individuals while preserving interpretability and confirmatory structure. A self-consistency principle guides the estimation of attention profiles, ensuring coherence with individual response patterns under entropy and stability constraints. Simulation studies demonstrate that, when identification conditions hold, self-consistent attention aligns with the underlying measurement structure, and when such conditions are violated, CFASA converges to a stable, profile-respecting estimand. An empirical application illustrates how CFASA reveals substantively interpretable measurement heterogeneity that is obscured by traditional CFA. Rather than treating violations of measurement invariance as deficiencies, CFASA reframes them as informative features of individual-level measurement.
